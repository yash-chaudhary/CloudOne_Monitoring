## Project Name
CLOUDOne Monitoring ☁️

## Description
Investigate Open API data sets to monitor AWS & Azure clouds, integrate those APIs with myWizard AiOps Service Integrator to pull the information and send to Splunk, create a dashboard to visualize the monitoring parameters for the businesses.

## Scope
Build a monitoring dashboard in Splunk by pulling data from AWS cloud watch & Azure monitor cloud’s using Service Integrator.

## Solution
Developed a MVP of an end-to-end cloud monitoring system using Accenture's myWizard AIOps Service Integrator. The product monitored metric data such as CPU utilisation of cloud instances in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Using REST APIs in the Service Integrator, the raw metric data was pulled from the cloud platforms, transformed using a Jolt spec and clean data was sent to Splunk for visualisation.
