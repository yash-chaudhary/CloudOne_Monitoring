# Solution
Developed a MVP of an end-to-end cloud monitoring system using Accenture's myWizard AIOps Service Integrator. The product monitored metric data such as CPU utilisation of cloud instances in AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Using REST APIs in the Service Integrator, the raw metric data was pulled from the cloud platforms, transformed using a Jolt spec and clean data was sent to Splunk for visualisation.
